# Edgar's Takehome for Turion
Hey everybody! I cobbled together all the MVP requirements as quickly as I could, but tried to treat this like I would any other project I do at work. Because of time constraints I won't be able to hit all of the bonuses I'd like, but if I had a full week I would have loved to.

## How to run
1. Ensure that you have [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](docker) installed
2. Run the command `docker-compose up --build`. To run in detached mode, simply add the `-d` flag to the command
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000/dashboard](localhost:3000/dashboard) to see a simple dashboard and table that hits all the requirements for this takehome

I've already spent way more time on this than I anticipated - there may have been things that I could have done better (especially comments, tests, READMEs, etc.) Please reach out to me at echin522@gmail.com if you have any questions!
